"""Runtime patch: scope vLLM's AOT compile artifact directory to the running GPU.

vLLM stores the artifact at ``torch_aot_compile/<hash>/rank_{rank}_{dp_rank}/model``
(``vllm/compilation/decorators.py``). The hash covers env and config factors but
carries no device, and the directory distinguishes only rank and DP rank, so two
engines that agree on both -- separate placement groups, or separate runs sharing
a cache root, each holding bundle index 0 -- resolve to one path while sitting on
different GPUs. The last save wins, and a load on any other GPU runs Inductor
wrappers holding the saver's stream handle::

    RuntimeError: CUDA driver error: invalid argument
        static_triton_launcher._launch_kernel <- profile_run -> _dummy_run

This inserts the device into that directory (``rank_0_0`` -> ``rank_0_0_dev1``).
The hash-level directory and the ``inductor_cache/`` beneath it stay shared:
Triton keys its own cache by device index, and Inductor's graph hash covers input
tensor devices, so that tree is already partitioned by device. Keying on the
device index rather than the UUID matches what the generated code bakes in, so
workers masked onto their own device 0 keep sharing one artifact.

Remove once vllm#53312 (device index in the per-rank cache path) ships.
