"""Skip Megatron's MLA THD value pad on Blackwell (sm100+).

For packed (``qkv_format="thd"``) execution, Megatron-core pads the MLA value
tensor from ``v_head_dim`` (e.g. 128) up to the QK head dim (e.g. 192) in
``_prepare_mla_core_attention_value`` and trims the attention output back
afterwards.

On Blackwell that pad is fatal for training: cuDNN fused attention has no
backward support for ``head_dim > 128`` on sm100+, so with the padded
``head_dim_v == head_dim_qk == 192`` TransformerEngine disables FusedAttention
for training-mode forwards. FlashAttention 2 does not support MLA at all,
FlashAttention 3 is sm90-only, and UnfusedDotProductAttention does not support
context parallelism - so MLA + CP training raises
``ValueError: No dot product attention backend is available``. Inference-mode
forwards (logprob computation) are unaffected, which makes the failure appear
only at the first ``forward_backward``.

cuDNN fused attention natively supports MLA's unequal QK/V head dims
(192/128), including THD + context parallelism with the ``p2p`` exchange, for
both forward and backward. Skipping the pad simply selects that native path
(and saves the pad/trim memory traffic). Behavior on pre-Blackwell devices is
left unchanged.
