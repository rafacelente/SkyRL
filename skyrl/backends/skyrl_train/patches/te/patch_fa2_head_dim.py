"""Backport of NVIDIA/TransformerEngine#3360 for transformer-engine 2.16.0.

TE 2.16.0 gates FlashAttention 2 for ``head_dim > 192`` behind a compute
capability allowlist of ``(8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0), (12, 0)``. Upstream removed
that allowlist in #2836, #2629 accidentally reintroduced it, and #3360 removes
it again -- keeping only the real FA2 constraints (``head_dim <= 256`` and
``head_dim % 8 == 0``).

On an architecture outside the allowlist -- notably sm103 (B300/GB300) -- a
head_dim of 256 (Gemma 2/3, for example) makes TE reject FA2. If cuDNN fused
attention is also unavailable for the config, TE drops to unfused attention,
which materializes the quadratic attention matrix; upstream reported a 202 GiB
allocation and an OOM at 65k tokens.

This is applied as a source-level rebind rather than an edit to the installed
wheel: TE ships as a prebuilt wheel from Astral's CUDA index, and
``uv run --isolated`` builds a throwaway environment per invocation, so a
site-packages edit would not survive a run (nor reach other Ray nodes).
``get_attention_backend`` is a single ~1000 line function and the gate is an
inline boolean clause, so there is no sub-function seam to override -- we
recompile that one function with the clause removed and rebind it on its
module. Its only caller resolves it as a module attribute
(``dpa_utils.get_attention_backend``), so the rebind is picked up.

DELETE THIS PATCH once the transformer-engine pin moves to a release that
contains #3360. This is a temporary backport of an upstream fix, not a SkyRL
behavior change, and it has no reason to outlive the pin it works around.
It fails safe in the meantime: the match below is against the literal 2.16.0
source text, and TE expresses the same check against ``fa2_padded_head_dim``
after the padding refactor, so on a newer TE this logs and no-ops rather than
misfiring. That means a stale copy is quiet rather than harmful -- which also
means nothing will alert you to remove it. Check this file when bumping TE.
